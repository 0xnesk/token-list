# Safe Tokenlist

Safe default token list.

This list contains tokens which appear by default in the Safe wallet interface and are not part of the imported default token lists.

## Maintaining the list

Currently this list only holds the Safe token. There is no process in place to add more tokens to this list.

## Deployment

This repo automatically deploys to staging, when `main` is updated and prepares a prod release if a new release is published.
